Coding Standards
----------------

1. BRACE STYLE FOR CONTROL STATEMENTS

   All control statements (if, else, for, while, do, switch) must use braces,
   even for single-statement bodies. The opening brace should be on the same
   line as the control statement, and the body should be on subsequent lines.

   Bad:
       if (!ptr) return NULL;
       if (x > 0) x--;

   Good:
       if (!ptr) {
           return NULL;
       }
       if (x > 0) {
           x--;
       }

   This rule improves readability and prevents errors when adding statements
   to control blocks.

2. INDENTATION

   Use 4 spaces for indentation. Do not use tabs.

3. LINE LENGTH

   Prefer lines under 100 characters. Break long lines at logical points.

4. NAMING CONVENTIONS

   - Types: suffix with _t (e.g., token_t, ast_node_t)
   - Functions: lowercase with underscores (e.g., parser_advance)
   - Constants/Macros: uppercase with underscores (e.g., MOD_PUBLIC)
   - Local variables: lowercase with underscores

5. COMMENTS

   - Use /* */ for all comments
   - File headers should include copyright and license information
   - Document non-obvious code with explanatory comments

6. MEMORY MANAGEMENT

   - Always check return values of malloc/calloc
   - Free allocated memory in appropriate cleanup paths
   - Use consistent patterns for resource acquisition and release
